## HOW TO COMPILE THE PROJECT 

1. Open launch.py and run the script.
2. Now the project is compiled and app.exe should appear in the root folder.

## HOW TO RUN THE SIMULATION AND NAVIGATE IT 

1. Run app.exe
2. After running the application you should see:
	a window with simulated particles,
	and a command line with instructions and logs.
3. The simulations consists of 500 partices attracted to each other by the force of gravity with collisions.
4. Following the instructions in the command line, you are able to manipulate the simulation:
	To turn on/off window border collisions (bouncing off the edges of the window) press SPACEBAR - default setting is OFF.
	To clear ALL particles, press X.
	To spawn more partices on screen either: 
		press ENTER (spawns 50 particles at random coordinates), or 
		press LEFT MOUSE BUTTON (continuously spawns particles at the mouse coordinates until the button is released).
	To speed up the simulation, press RIGHT ARROW
	To slow down the simulation, press LEFT ARROW
5. To exit the simulation, simply close either the command line or the window.
